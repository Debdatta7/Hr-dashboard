# Analyzed HR (Human Resources) data and created dashboards using Power BI 


## Questions solved:
* How many people are in each job?
* Gender break-down of the staff
* Age spread of the staff
* Which jobs pay more?
* Top earners in each job
* Qualification vs. Salary
* Staff growth trend over time
* Employee filter by starting letter
* Leave balance analysis
* Quick HR Dashboard


## My learnings:
*  Loading data into Power BI and cleaning it with Power Query
*  Creating HR metrics like headcount, avg. leave balance, avg. salary etc. with Power Pivot
*  Adding columns to the data (like Employee's first name, age group etc.)
*  Finding relationships between salary and education qualification
*  Using visual filters to see top / bottom paid staff in each job
*  Customizing visuals in Power BI (changing colors, axis, labels and legend)
*  Advanced DAX calculations like cumulative headcount, leave balance more than 20 days 
*  Designing a monthly HR dashboard with Power BI
